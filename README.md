# 🧠 AS91896 & AS91897 Combined Project – Task Manager Application

This repository contains your individual project for the combined assessment of:

- **AS91896 v3** – Develop an advanced computer program (Level 2)
- **AS91897 v3** – Use advanced processes to develop a digital technologies outcome (Level 2)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

You will design, develop, test, and evaluate a **task manager application** using **Python with Tkinter**. Your goal is to build a working digital outcome that helps users manage and track tasks. The program must be functional, flexible, and built using advanced programming techniques, while following a structured project management process.

---

## 🎯 Assessment Goals

### You will be assessed on:

🔹 **AS91896 – Programming**
- Using appropriate variables, control structures, and input/output
- Applying *at least two* advanced programming techniques
- Testing/debugging your program (expected and boundary cases)
- Writing clean, well-commented, PEP8-compliant code
- Making your program flexible and robust
- Producing a logical, well-structured solution

🔹 **AS91897 – Project Management**
- Planning using Gantt chart or Trello
- Decomposing the outcome into smaller components
- Trialling and selecting suitable components or techniques
- Using Git and version control effectively
- Addressing relevant implications (e.g. IP, accessibility, usability)
- Reflecting on planning, trialling, and testing to refine your outcome
